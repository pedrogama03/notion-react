<h3>Consistency:</h3>
<p>Tailwind CSS promotes design consistency throughout your project. By adhering to a predefined set of utility classes, you can maintain a cohesive visual style without worrying about individual CSS inconsistencies.</p>

<h3>Readability and Maintainability:</h3>
<p>With utility classes directly applied in the HTML, it's easier to understand how styles are being applied to each element. This enhances the readability of your code and simplifies maintenance, as there's no need to switch between HTML and CSS files.</p>
